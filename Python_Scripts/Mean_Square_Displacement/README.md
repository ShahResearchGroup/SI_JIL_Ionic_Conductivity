# Python Script for mean-square-displacement (MSD) Calculation

# This Python script calculates the mean-square-displacement (MSD) of cation and anion in pure ionic liquids using Einstein formalism. The *.trr and *.tpr file from the GROMACS simulation are required for computing MSD.

# To begin, run `transport_setup.sh`.

# Once `transport_setup.sh` is complete, run `transport_analysis.py`.

# Output Units: delta or time in ps and MSD in Ã…^2
